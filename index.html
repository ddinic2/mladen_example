                        What is a VPN?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="section_p">
                        The best way to visualize a VPN is to look at it as if it were a
                        <a href="########">version of a physical computer
                        network.</a>
                        The difference comes in the means of connection.
                        <br><br>
                        Physical computer networks are usually limited to some location, such as a home or office, and
                        the computers are physically interlinked. The VPN is a virtual type of network, allowing
                        different computers, no matter where they’re located, to join the network and use it to access
                        the internet. The physical connection still remains, but now it consists of both public and
                        private cables, routers and servers. And there are no range limits whatsoever.
                        <br><br>
                        So, a VPN is not some new groundbreaking device that allows computers to act like they’re
                        physically interlinked, but it’s a method of connecting computers in a virtual network.
                        This method is designed to enhance security and improve the privacy of the end user, without
                        any restrictions when it comes to accessing content on the internet.

                    <p class="section_p">
                        To access a VPN, you’ll need to get a free or paid VPN service; we’ll talk about the differences
                        between the two later. Once you do so, you’ll get a VPN client installed on your computer or
                        mobile device and that’s where it all begins.

                            With a VPN client, you’ll gain access to a pre-setup VPN, put in place by the provider. While
                            you browse the internet via the VPN, your computer doesn’t communicate by using the IP address
                            assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider(ISP). Instead, it uses one provided by the VPN.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to masking your initial IP address, a VPN also secures all the data. So, how is data
                            confidentiality achieved? VPNs use protocols to encode all the data exchanged between your
                            computer and the computer which you use as a sort of gateway to access the internet. Here are
                            the most commonly used encryption protocols:
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <ul class="section_ul">
                            <li>
                                <strong>•	L2TP/IPsec</strong> – Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol was created as a collaborative effort by
                                members of the PPTP forum, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Cisco.
                                This protocol is called L2TP over IPsec because it provides the security of IPsec over
                                the tunneling of L2TP. This protocol is used by VPNs running on Windows 2000 OS.
                                <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>•	IPsec</strong> – Powered by very strong encryption algorithms and wide-ranging authentication,
                                Internet Protocol Security Protocol offers additional layers to data security.
                                IPsec encrypts the data via tunnel and transport. Transport encryption mode encodes
                                the payload, or the essential content, of data, while tunnel mode encodes both the header
                                and payload of data.
                                <br><br>
                                In order to use this encryption protocol, all devices connected to the network must
                                use a common key/certificate. A special app installed on a user PC handles this
                                encoding/decoding during connection with a remote VPN. This encryption protocol has
                                support for 56-bit and 168-bit encryption.
                                <br><br>

                                <strong>•	PPTP/MPPE</strong> – While PPTP is an obsolete protocol, many VPNs are still running it.
                                It was created through the joint efforts of ECI Telematics, US Robotics, 3COM,
                                Microsoft and Ascend. It supports 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, using MPPE – Microsoft
                                Point-to-Point Encryption.

                            In addition to these encryption protocols, other protocols can be used by a VPN, such as
                            Non Repudiation, AAA, Data Integrity, Traffic Flow Confidentiality,
                            <a href="######">SOCKS5</a> and Anti Replay.
                            The protocols used by a VPN determine the services they can offer users. We’ll address this in

                        What are the unique benefits of using a VPN?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="section_p">
                        Security. As already mentioned, security is a primary concern for anyone who’s online.
                        The data on the internet may be intercepted, stolen or even altered. This can have serious
                        consequences for users, including stolen credit cards and a leak of sensitive corporate information.
                        Communication from you to the outside world
                        <a href="######">can’t be fully protected</a>
                        by firewall and antivirus software installed on the computer.
                        <br><br>
                        Since the communication between your PC and a VPN is established through the protocols we
                        described, the connection between your PC and remote resources is secure. If any of the routers
                        get compromised by a hacker, it won’t be possible for him to decrypt the data flow between you
                        and the VPN computers.

                        Privacy. Keeping your identity hidden while online is also very important. Without a VPN, your
                        identity can easily be revealed by marketing agencies or anyone who’s curious enough and has
                        sufficient skills. And when we talk about identity, we mean IP address, name, address and
                        location. While you’re on the net, your device communicates with routers and web servers,
                        leaving behind information about your IP and ISP.
                        <br><br>
                        A VPN successfully prevents this undesired disclosure of private information. While accessing
                        content online through a VPN, the VPN provider’s identity becomes your own. You will appear to
                        be online on a location other than your own, while your personal information, including the IP
                        address, remains hidden.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Unrestricted Access.</b> Many companies offer their online services with specific geographical
                        restrictions. For instance, Netflix is still not available in many countries around the world.
                        Similar to this, there are countries that forbid their citizens to access certain websites and
                        companies who restrict their employees’ internet use. A VPN easily overcomes these obstacles.
                        <br><br>
                        Since there are VPN providers in many geographic regions, users can easily go around any
                        geographical restrictions put in place either by a foreign company or their country.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Better Web Experience.</b> Connectivity issues are a very common problem around the globe,
                        especially when you want to access something that’s on the other side of the world.
                        Due to poor internet routes and limited bandwidth, your overall online experience may be poor.

                        <b>This can be solved by a VPN.</b> When using a VPN, your bandwidth while accessing remote locations
                        will be approximately the same as the bandwidth between the VPN and your computer. A VPN
                        solution is very beneficial for users whose ISP providers enforce bandwidth limits

                        forwarding, which makes other devices on your network accessible via the internet.

                        What to look for in a good VPN service?
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="section_p">
                        The best VPN service is the one whose services completely meet your needs. This is why you have
                        to identify those needs before selecting a VPN provider. That being said, there’s a consensus
                        for what general services and features a good VPN service provider delivers.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Security.</strong> Since you’re going to place all information about your browsing, along with your
                        personal information, into someone else’s hands, it’s of utmost importance to make sure that
                        the VPN service provider secures VPN nodes, website and infrastructure.
                        <br><br>
                        Good VPN service providers have regular security audits, PCI compliance, web application
                        firewalls, dedicated server hardware and secured/reliable servers.
                        <br><br>
                        <storng>Software.</storng>A good VPN service provider also has user-friendly software.
                        This is essential, because you don’t want to troubleshoot software with customer support
                        every time you connect to a VPN. Good software is easy to set up and will get you online in
                        no time. So make sure to see if the VPN provider has its own custom software.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Locations of VPN servers.</strong>Good VPN service providers have servers in more than
                        one geographical location. This allows you to have unrestricted access to any content, no matter
                        where it’s hosted. So make sure the VPN provider has servers spread around the globe before
                        purchasing their services.
                        <br><br>
                        Keep in mind that the USA, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, called the Five Eyes, have
                        agreed to exchange information in order to enhance security. This means that a government of
                        any of these five countries can compel a VPN provider, through a court order, to disclose any
                        information it holds. This does not apply to VPN providers that are based in any other country
                        in the world.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Customer Support.</strong>This is also a very important factor that differentiates the
                        good from the not-so-good VPN providers. Customer support has to be accessible 24/7, so that
                        you can get your problems solved regardless of the time zone difference. The good ones will
                        have a self-service help desk and live chat support at their users’ disposal.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>No data logging.</strong>Most people choose a VPN solution because they’re concerned
                        about privacy and security. If you want to stay completely hidden behind the VPN, you have to
                        read the VPN provider’s terms of use and policy in order to make sure they do not log your data.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Speed.</strong>The bandwidth may go down when you’re accessing the net via VPN.
                        You want to make sure that the VPN provider invests in new servers and software in order to
                        meet the needs of a large influx of new users. You can get an idea of this by reading the
                        reviews of their users. With a good VPN provider, you should only experience very small

                        want without facing any penalties.

                            This is basically all you need to know about VPN services. You’ve seen that a VPN not only
                            provides a better web experience, but it also addresses security and privacy concerns.

                            restrictions. We hope the information you’ve found in this article will make it easier
                            for you to decide if you want to go with a VPN service provider and how to choose the best
                            one for your needs.
